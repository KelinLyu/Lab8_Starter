#### Question (1)
I choose (1) because it is mentioned in the paragraphs above: "code getting pushed to the remote repository..."
#### Question (2)
No, becuase it does not involve emulating user actions from start to finish.
#### Question (3)
No, becuase the messaging feature has the interactions between many modules such as the keyboard module (for mobile apps), spell-check module, network module, etc.
#### Question (4)
Maybe. If such feature is just a function retuning true or false, then yes, because it is almost independent among everything else. However, if it needs to show a fancy alert box to the user, which interacts with the alert box module, then the answer is no.
